## Element Properties (New)
- Temperature
- Hardness
- Diffusion
- Weight
- Flammable
- Explosive
- Meltable
- HeatConductivity
- ElectricConductivity

## New Elements
- Solid
  * Copper - Rust-proof metal that conducts electricity, also conducts heat very well
  * Steel - Metal that does not conduct electricity, but conducts heat very well, it can rust when exposed to water
  * Wire - If connected with two ends of Copper, electricity can safely pass from one to the other
  * Vine - Grows randomly when painted, unlike Plant which requires Water to grow

- Liquid
  * Gas - Flammable, burns for a long time, creates mini-explosions when burning out
  * Mud - Made when Dirt contacts Water, dries into Dirt
  * Molten Plastic - Created when Plastic is heated, becomes Plastic when cooled

- Gas
  * Hydrogen - Extremely flammable, creates large explosions
  * Blue Fire - Behaves exactly like Fire, but applies cooling instead of heating

- Powder
  * Dust - Lightweight powder created by various reactions, mildly flammable and burns extremely fast
  * Concrete Powder - Becomes Concrete when mixed with Water
  * Rust - Created when certain metals are exposde to water

- Special
  * Chaos - Transforms into an entirely random element when created
  * Separator - Elements that touch it can be split into their component elements, if possible (Example: Water -> Hydrogen + Air)
  * Spawner - Generates an infinite amount of the first element applied to it
  * Converter - Converts any element that touches it into the first element applied to it
  * Electricity - Can be used to power or charge things, travels along conductive materials, can also ignite flammable elements
  * Katamari - Absorbs any element that touches it and grows larger


## New Objects
* Switch - Clickable toggle switch, when activated, it will allow electricity to pass through until deactivated
* Button - Clickable momentary switch, when activated, it will allow electricity to pass through for a few ticks
* Bouncy Ball - A simple ball that bounces on solids and floats on liquids
